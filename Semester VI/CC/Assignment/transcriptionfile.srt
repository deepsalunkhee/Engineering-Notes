00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:02,849
Ok. Uh Hello, Ivan.

1
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:07,730
So I have been working on this project, uh Hospital Bank uh for the last few days.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,850
So let's start the demo of this project

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,539
before, but before getting into demo, um I would like to discuss that.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,639
W what was the problem statement that I chose for this project?

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,399
Ok. So when uh we live with a roommate or, you know, in hostel,

6
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,700
normally what happens? We lend our friend some money

7
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:29,840
and uh after that, it's really hard to keep track of like how much we uh

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,370
give, how much we have to take

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,380
and all that stuff.

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,569
OK. So for that, there are various application available uh out there.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,840
So I thought, why not we create our own application for this? OK.

12
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:42,819
So that's why I created this.

13
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,689
Uh So let's start.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,939
OK. So first, uh let's uh sign in

15
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:50,049
uh will I will use this account?

16
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:51,080
Ok. So for

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,680
signing, I have used basic logic that I have,

18
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,500
uh I uh we just pass the email and the password.

19
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,700
Then I have also used

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,310
decrypt for

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,610
loading the password,

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,000
um you know, for the security of the user data

23
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,959
so that even if data was compromises, the password remains secure.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,559
Ok.

25
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:09,980
So let's sign in.

26
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,099
So once you sign in, we will uh

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,150
get into this, the home page.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,540
And yeah, along with the signing for

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,379
signing for authentication and for authorization, I have used JW

30
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:23,150
token.

31
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,230
So that user uh don't need to, uh, sign in again and again,

32
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,470
if uh they close the tab right now, for example, if I close this tab right now

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,419
and I just

34
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:34,129
uh uh

35
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:37,580
you know, uh went to the same homepage, same website.

36
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,099
So let's say uh

37
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:41,540
OK.

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,489
Yeah, so I automatically get signed into the

39
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,449
account, right?

40
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,360
Why? Because I have to wear the,

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,569
you know, uh the token, uh a

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,459
local student

43
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:54,139
will automatically get uh used for signing.

44
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,379
OK.

45
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,430
So, OK, let's,

46
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,959
let's just see how this token actually is transmitted to backend uh as soon as we,

47
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,080
you know, uh enter this page.

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:04,800
OK.

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,209
So if we just uh

50
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:07,959
go to the networks

51
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,830
and let's say I go to this group P A

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,500
request is sent to the back end to get the group info

53
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,210
right now. This user has not any uh not joined any groups. So it's empty.

54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,509
So if I go on this request and uh look here for something as token. Yeah. So token,

55
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,300
you will see this screen. So this is nothing but AJ W token

56
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,779
which helps to authorize this user. OK?

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,779
And if we go,

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,429
uh you know, on uh let's say a

59
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,270
WT dot A

60
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:36,490
U,

61
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,460
we can also see what exactly this uh

62
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,339
a token is saying or sending to the back

63
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:43,889
that

64
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:44,600
it here

65
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:45,639
you will see here

66
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,520
what exactly

67
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,389
uh is the content of this thing.

68
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,240
So yeah, we know we cannot read it directly,

69
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,639
we can see it, but actually, we cannot authorize it uh or check it when

70
00:02:55,779 --> 00:03:00,440
five is true or not. That can be done only using the key uh which is present on the back.

71
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,330
OK. So yeah, so that was about arthritis. And, and

72
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,339
I

73
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:05,750
thank the

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,539
uh so let's continue.

75
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,389
Uh So let's, let's create a group

76
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,509
uh inside our application.

77
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,539
So let's, we will go to the create a group tab

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,820
and here we will, let's say, create a group names, let's say

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,660
uh

80
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:23,509
OK.

81
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,190
OK.

82
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,660
And create.

83
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,669
So as soon as we click on, create groups,

84
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,570
uh a group is created and we,

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,820
we get uh a code to join that group so we can share this code uh with whomever you want uh

86
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,669
to be a part of that group. OK.

87
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,690
So I'll copy this one. OK.

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,839
Now the code is copy. And if I go to groups

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,320
here, I will see the uh list of the group that I have joined

90
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,789
right now. If we try to enter this group,

91
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,550
uh we will see there is only one member

92
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,970
because no one else is present in this book. OK?

93
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:05,460
So let's do one thing I will use another account to join this group. OK.

94
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,860
So yeah, so I have already signed in

95
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,910
um

96
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,619
to another account

97
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,470
uh in another tab. OK. Let's go to join groups

98
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,820
and I will paste that group code

99
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,548
here and join group.

100
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,510
OK? So after some time, I will get a message

101
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,839
that I have joined the group

102
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:25,390
and here. So I have joined host

103
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,369
group successfully.

104
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:28,230
So if I go to groups

105
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,440
then yeah. So here you will see the hospital group

106
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:32,760
and if I go in that group,

107
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:34,529
you will see the both

108
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,730
accounts,

109
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,869
the account, our account, my account, the current

110
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,890
that is this Don

111
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:39,519
at gmail

112
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,309
and the other uh

113
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,940
individuals that have, that have written in this book.

114
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,429
So let's do one thing.

115
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:49,000
Uh let's create a request of let's say ₹10

116
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,359
for, let's say a good week.

117
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,820
Ok.

118
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,700
And send a request.

119
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,179
So as soon as I send the request,

120
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,380
uh we'll get a pop up saying the request has done successfully

121
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,299
and you can see here uh a ₹10

122
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,920
amount has been added in the section of to

123
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,380
take.

124
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:09,600
OK.

125
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,690
Now, uh if we go to email of uh this person, we will see we will get a notification,

126
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:16,660
right?

127
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,899
So yeah, so we hello, we have got a notification

128
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,589
of type request

129
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,519
and if we again go to that person's account,

130
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,859
we have to just to refresh this. So we will uh

131
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,489
OK, just OK, this is the issue of uh

132
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,329
because it doesn't allow

133
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,489
direct jumping from the end point.

134
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,350
So we just have to

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,299
go to home page.

136
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:38,980
Yeah.

137
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:41,089
Ok.

138
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,980
So yeah, so when I will Yeah, so

139
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,079
get notifications

140
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,679
if we see you, I will get a request of ₹10 and notice will pay.

141
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,420
Now let's say

142
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,500
I will say, ok, I have got a request now let's say

143
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:57,130
I want to pay this and I paid it using my le lets A GP

144
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,579
you know what I will do.

145
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:02,480
I will go to groups in that group. I will enter that group

146
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,029
and click on

147
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,049
set up.

148
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,269
Once I settle this,

149
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,720
uh I will be if you would ask us

150
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,190
a G

151
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:11,109
if you want to settle it.

152
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,359
And yes, so we'll see that. Ok?

153
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,149
And the amount here will become zero.

154
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,540
Now,

155
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,010
if I go to the f

156
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:20,010
of this

157
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:21,019
account,

158
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,200
you will see that

159
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,250
uh there is an uh a notification that you have sent ₹10

160
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,570
to this particular account. On this day, we

161
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:33,730
will keep track of when we send how much rupees to one person.

162
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,630
And if we again go back to the

163
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:37,679
other account,

164
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,140
you will see

165
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,070
a notification that you have received 10

166
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,040
₹10

167
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,670
on this date from this account.

168
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,049
And in the history tab

169
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,000
as

170
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,760
well, you will see you have ₹15.

171
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,649
So

172
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,630
all the history is maintained here.

173
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,790
Additionally, you will receive an email every time uh his

174
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,540
order notifications arrived. Ok?

175
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,850
So you will you can keep track of everything that the transaction that you have made,

176
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,100
the request that you have received.

177
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,579
So it will become easy to calculate all that stuff at the end of the month. OK.

178
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,079
So now this is where the notification feature,

179
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,459
uh the group's feature

180
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,399
where you can see all the groups create group feature

181
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,589
where you can create the group join group feature,

182
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,179
where you can join the group if you have an ID

183
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,880
history feature,

184
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,899
uh where you will see all the money that you have spent and received

185
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,230
and I then this setting.

186
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,989
So in this setting, uh I have given us a feature to change your password.

187
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,970
So the logic for this is that when you uh enter your old password

188
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,630
and the new password that you want to uh set out your uh

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,790
password

190
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,809
and just check uh with the,

191
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,619
the data

192
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,320
that is this password

193
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:47,470
and the

194
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:50,149
password that current database have is same.

195
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,299
And if it just updates uh

196
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,989
to the new password, ok,

197
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,149
then additional features that I have provided is uh when,

198
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,920
when you forget your passport.

199
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,679
So for that, let's sign up.

200
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,600
OK.

201
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:06,630
So when you sign up, there is an option of forget, forgot password.

202
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,230
When you click here, uh

203
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,309
you just have to interview with email.

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,359
And if you,

205
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,290
you with email,

206
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,540
you will get a

207
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:19,730
uh a pass uh uh an email which will have a du a dummy password, a temporary password.

208
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,070
Uh that you can use to log in after that, you can uh change it.

209
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:24,730
OK?

210
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:26,880
So this was about the application

211
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:27,839
now about

212
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,589
the interesting part about the deployment.

213
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,820
So I have deployed both this application,

214
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,690
the, the applications on,

215
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,760
you know, a

216
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,820
ver version

217
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:36,580
platform

218
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,119
and as well as on aws. OK. So this one that I was using, so this one

219
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,419
is AWS dash

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:42,820
by,

221
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,059
uh I was able to log in uh with two different accounts in same tab. Uh,

222
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,530
otherwise, uh, you won't be able to do that

223
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,340
because basically like there are two different websites.

224
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:52,969
So, yeah,

225
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,700
so, uh on personal, it was pretty simple

226
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,859
but while deploying on Aws, I have tried to deploy it using wages services like uh

227
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,080
next day. Uh

228
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,909
ok, so this, this is a database that I have been using

229
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,090
uh to storing the data and all the transactions.

230
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,169
Yeah. And one more, one more interesting thing

231
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:16,679
that uh for storing a transaction of a group. I have used mattress,

232
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,830
I have, I have, uh used mattresses that

233
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,320
because I wanted to add one more feature that I'm working on,

234
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,179
which is, uh, you know, like auto

235
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,700
depth normalization means what let's say there are, uh, let's say, uh, in the group,

236
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,109
there are use that ABC.

237
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,570
If a, give a ₹10 to BB, gave ₹10 C

238
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:39,929
and C give ₹10 to A, then, you know,

239
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,450
we can normalize it like no one has to give

240
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,130
any amount back to anyone because they are settled.

241
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:48,489
So this was something that I am planning to implement.

242
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:49,809
And I think uh

243
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,580
by storing the transaction of a group in a matrix,

244
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,229
it can be acute.

245
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,390
So that's why I have stored it in the mattress. Ok.

246
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,190
So for the deployment,

247
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,909
so yes, this is my

248
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,080
Aws Council Council

249
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,020
and uh

250
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,039
I have deployed the backend on Aws

251
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:07,630
app runner.

252
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:09,590
Uh

253
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,559
Yeah. So

254
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,159
this is the deployment of the back end.

255
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,919
And for the front end,

256
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,429
I have used aws amplifier

257
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,090
and I have done another deployment just for exploring purpose that I tried to

258
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:24,880
use github actions.

259
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,530
Uh

260
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,539
uh What do I mean by uh bit of action is that I directly use, you know,

261
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,340
created ac two instance on Aws.

262
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,390
Uh

263
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,140
Let me show you that

264
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,090
uh

265
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:38,609
a very

266
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,020
OK.

267
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:43,239
Yeah.

268
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,890
Yeah. So,

269
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,590
so what I did here was I already created a E two instance

270
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,419
uh then use the github

271
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,700
action. Uh This is the runner part uh runner that they provide

272
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,380
uh which uh helps

273
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:03,020
us to directly deploy uh my changes in the code uh in

274
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,400
the institute instance in that institute instance, I use Docker.

275
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,960
So basically, I didn't actually

276
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,159
uh directly created the environment inside the instant rather than I uh what I did,

277
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:15,630
I use the

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,570
Docker images uh

279
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,669
to do not to uh I important

280
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,960
Docker images on that

281
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,940
particular instrument.

282
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,489
Then uh then that landed a Docker images for the

283
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,599
front and backend separately and both of them are communicated.

284
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:33,070
So that was the logic that I used. Uh

285
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,099
So for that the,

286
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,950
the Docker

287
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:38,030
plot I created uh was this one?

288
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,770
So, yeah, so

289
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:38,909
for

290
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,739
that, you know, this is the basic Docker file

291
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:41,750
where I have

292
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,760
depend on the requirements and the a step that I have to take.

293
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,030
And uh

294
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,539
for, you know, for deployment purpose for C I CD,

295
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,119
I use this uh yeah, wireless file

296
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,309
where this was divided into two parts.

297
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,469
The first part was two building uh where I just uh

298
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,080
uh you know, I

299
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,599
put that image from the docket

300
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,919
and then build it and deploy it on that particular instance.

301
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,789
So yeah, so this was the part regarding the deployment

302
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,340
that I explored like using three services ac two instances

303
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:15,130
uh

304
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,900
where I used Docker,

305
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,099
uh I use Docker

306
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,380
up to

307
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,409
import I, I put it from the images from the dock it up

308
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:24,099
and let me show

309
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,159
you that images. Yeah.

310
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,489
So these were the

311
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,989
images that I was importing

312
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:29,679
there.

313
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:36,270
Then uh the prior that I showed was using uh app runner and the amplifier

314
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,409
app runner for the

315
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:38,929
los part for the back end uh

316
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,059
express server. And uh for react, I used uh the amplifier

317
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,109
service.

318
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,849
So yeah, this was a basic production.

319
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,440
And how are you

320
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,809
uh the project? Yeah. Additionally, for the notification part,

321
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,200
I have used the

322
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,200
uh note mailer along with Bravo

323
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,919
uh which provides you the service to send emails to the,

324
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,030
you know, your users. Uh It's a free API

325
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,250
uh So it has limited number of messages that you can send, but it's free.

326
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,710
Yeah.

327
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,369
So I also tried that. So

328
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,869
basically it was uh

329
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:11,210
or

330
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,200
it was a very good, great project.

331
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,479
I got to explore various things.

332
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,340
Yeah. So do try it out.

333
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,270
I will provide both the links uh the one of that,

334
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:21,669
uh, the

335
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:21,909
blood

336
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,299
person

337
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:26,159
and the other of the Aws. But mostly I will,

338
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,840
uh, pause the,

339
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,989
one of, uh, the Aws link, uh, because, yeah, it's a free

340
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,669
account

341
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,340
and I don't want to finish all my grades. So, yeah, so

342
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,340
do try it out

343
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,330
and see you in the next. Thank you.
