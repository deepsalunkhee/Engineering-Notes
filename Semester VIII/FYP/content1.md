# **The Main Body of the Project**  

## **Chapter 1: Introduction**  

### **1.1 Background**  
In the digital age, video conferencing has become an essential tool for communication, especially with the rise of remote work and online collaboration. However, most existing video conferencing applications, such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, rely on centralized architectures where a central server (SFU - Selective Forwarding Unit) processes and redistributes audio and video streams. This centralized approach raises concerns about privacy, data security, and computational inefficiency.  

**BlockMeet** is a decentralized video conferencing application designed to eliminate dependency on centralized servers. Instead of relying on a single powerful server to handle all streams, BlockMeet distributes the computational load among participants using a **hydrocarbon-inspired peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture**. This ensures that sensitive audio and video data remain only within the meeting participants, enhancing privacy and reducing latency.  

### **1.2 Problem Statement**  
Existing video conferencing solutions face the following challenges:  
1. **Centralized Data Control**: All streams pass through a central server, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.  
2. **High Computational Load**: Processing multiple streams requires significant server resources, increasing costs.  
3. **Scalability Issues**: Mesh-based P2P architectures (where every peer connects to every other peer) become inefficient beyond a few participants due to excessive bandwidth and CPU usage.  

BlockMeet addresses these issues by:  
- Using a **decentralized hydrocarbon-structured P2P network** to distribute processing.  
- Storing shared files on **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** for decentralized file sharing.  
- Logging meeting activities on the **Polygon blockchain** for immutability and transparency.  

### **1.3 Methodology**  
The project follows an **iterative development approach**, incorporating:  
1. **Research & Analysis**: Studying existing video conferencing architectures (SFU, mesh networks).  
2. **Design**: Creating a hydrocarbon-structured P2P model for efficient data transfer.  
3. **Implementation**:  
   - Frontend: **React.js** for user interface.  
   - Backend: **Node.js** for authentication and meeting management.  
   - WebSocket Server: Manages real-time peer connections.  
   - Blockchain: **Smart contracts on Polygon testnet** for logging.  
4. **Testing**: Evaluating performance with multiple participants.  

### **1.4 Results & Future Scope**  
- **Results**:  
  - Successfully implemented a decentralized meeting system with up to **15 participants** without significant lag.  
  - Demonstrated **lower CPU usage** compared to full-mesh P2P.  
  - Integrated **IPFS for file storage** and **blockchain for logs**.  
- **Future Scope**:  
  - Improving scalability for larger meetings.  
  - Adding end-to-end encryption for enhanced security.  
  - Optimizing the WebSocket server for better performance.

## **Chapter 2: Literature Review**  

### **2.1 Existing Video Conferencing Architectures**  
#### **2.1.1 Centralized (SFU-Based) Architecture**  
- **Example**: Zoom, Google Meet  
- **How it Works**:  
  - Participants send streams to a central SFU server.  
  - The SFU processes and redistributes streams to all participants.  
- **Limitations**:  
  - Single point of failure.  
  - High server costs.  
  - Privacy concerns (data passes through a third-party server).

#### **2.1.2 Super Peer (Hybrid P2P) Architecture**  
- **Example**: Skype  
- **How it Works**:  
  - Uses multiple "super peers" to relay data.  
  - Reduces load compared to full centralization.  
- **Limitations**:  
  - Still relies on some centralized elements.  
  - Super peers require high bandwidth.

#### **2.1.3 Full-Mesh P2P Architecture**  
- **How it Works**:  
  - Every participant connects directly to every other participant.  
- **Limitations**:  
  - High CPU/bandwidth usage for each participant.  
  - Not scalable beyond 5-6 participants.  

### **2.2 Decentralized Alternatives**  
#### **2.2.1 Blockchain-Based Communication**  
- Projects like **Jitsi Meet** explore decentralized video calling.  
- **Limitation**: Still relies on external servers for signaling.  

#### **2.2.2 WebRTC for P2P Streaming**  
- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** enables direct browser-to-browser communication.  
- **Challenge**: NAT traversal issues require STUN/TURN servers.  

### **2.3 Research Gap & Innovation**  
- Most decentralized solutions still depend on some centralized components.  
- BlockMeet introduces:  
  - **Hydrocarbon-structured P2P** (better scalability than mesh).  
  - **IPFS for decentralized file storage**.  
  - **Blockchain logging for transparency**.

## **Chapter 3: System Design & Architecture**  

### **3.1 Hydrocarbon-Inspired P2P Model**  
- **Concept**:  
  - Participants are categorized into **super peers** and **normal peers**.  
  - Super peers act as relay nodes, reducing direct connections.  
- **Formula**:  
  - `Super Peer Count = Ceil(Total Participants / 3)`  
  - Ensures optimal load distribution.
